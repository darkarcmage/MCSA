			<p>Below are a few frequently asked questions about the Mountain Club of South Africa, Magaliesberg section.</p>
			<p>Click on the questions to reveal the answer</p>

				<h4 class="faqQ" id="q001">  How can I become a member of the MCSA Magaliesberg section?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA"id="a001">
					  <p> You have to attend 3 official Magaliesberg meets. Please check our <a href="events.php">calendar</a> for official meets. Tuesday club night evenings are not considered official meets.
					  You may list climbing at LC de Villiers with other Magaliesberg club members as an official meet. You will need to get two members to vouch for you and sign your <a href="join.php"> application form</a>.
					  </p>
					  </div>


					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q011">Why do I need two MCSA signatures?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a011">
					  <p> The MCSA owns and have access to many environmentally sensitive and potentially dangerous properties and areas. The two required signatories, is our attempt to assess your attitude towards nature and eliminate negligent individuals.</p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q002">What are the costs and benefits of being a member?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a002">
					  <p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_j_cMHaX3fzkd_10EoJU-XdkHdEjBhu4">Members fees</a> .
					  As a member you do not only get access to the property owned by the section you joined, but to all properties owned by the entire MCSA entity. You don�t strictly have to be a member for this but if you join and participate in our activities you have access to experienced members with treasure troves of knowledge to be mined.
					Many outdoor shops and climbing gyms offer discounts to MCSA members. You have to be able to show your MCSA membership card.
					</p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q003">What are required from me when I become a member?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a003">
					  <p> By joining the Magalies Section you effectively become part owner of all the properties and as such have share of the responsibility for the maintenance and safety thereof.  You have a choice to either participant in patrolling the properties or weeding the properties. While on the property we ask that you behave as an owner. I.e.: if you see a stranger, ask them if they are members or have a permit, else are trespassing, etc. <br><br>
						Patrolling: When on the properties, and not only when patrolling, we require you to keep an eye out for trespassers and problems such as fencing or fires, etc. <br><br>
						Your name will be added to a rotating patrolling roster that would require you to spend a weekend, once every 12-18 months, on a property. You may choose the property you want to patrol and may make an official club meet thereof. <br><br>
						Weeding: You are required to volunteer for weeding and work meets once a year. Conservation forms a major part of the MCSA�s responsibility towards the environment. Weeding forms a very important part of environmental management.
						</p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q004">Why are the fees and rules different for each MCSA section?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a004">
					  <p> Some MCSA sections owns property and thus the risks, rewards and costs are higher. Each section of the MCSA are managed  by a separate  committee which try to adhere to the unique requirements of that section's members.</p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q005">May I take friends, who are not MCSA members, to MCSA property?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a005">
					  <p> You may only take one friend with you. If you take more than one friend per MCSA member you have to apply for a permit by the section issueing permits for that property.
					  <br> Or alternatively you may make your trip an official MCSA meet and take a lot of non-memebers, however then the standard guest fee have to be paid to the club after the meet.</p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q006">What happens if I do not pay my membership fees?</h4>
