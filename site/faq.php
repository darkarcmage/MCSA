			<p>Below are a few frequently asked questions about the Mountain Club of South Africa, Magaliesberg section.</p>
			<p>Click on the questions to reveal the answer</p>

				<h4 class="faqQ" id="q001">How can I become a member of the MCSA Magaliesberg section?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA"id="a001">
					  <p> The club requires you to participate in some of the MCSA Magaliesberg events or attend the regular club evenings at the club house to meet with some of the members.
               You will need to get two members to vouch for you and sign your application form <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L9ozZmV-z81CzYbreeLyD679ecdD8Ax-" target="_blank">Application form</a>
            </p>
					  </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q011">Why do I need two MCSA signatures?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a011">
					  <p> The MCSA owns and have access to many environmentally sensitive and potentially dangerous properties and areas.
              The two required signatories, is our attempt to assess your attitude towards nature and eliminate negligent individuals.</p>					  </div>


              <h4  class="faqQ" id="q003">What are required from me when I become a member?</h4>
              <div class="faqA" id="a003">
              <p> By joining the Magalies Section you effectively become part owner of all the properties and as such have share of the responsibility for the maintenance and safety thereof.  You have a choice to either participant in patrolling the properties or weeding the properties. While on the property we ask that you behave as an owner. I.e.: if you see a stranger, ask them if they are members or have a permit, else are trespassing, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Patrolling: When on the properties, and not only when patrolling, we require you to keep an eye out for trespassers and problems such as fencing or fires, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your name will be added to a rotating patrolling roster that would require you to spend a weekend, once every 12-18 months, on a property. You may choose the property you want to patrol and may make an official club meet thereof.
              </p>

              <p>
                Weeding: You are required to volunteer for weeding and work meets once a year. Conservation forms a major part of the MCSA’s responsibility towards the environment. Weeding forms a very important part of environmental management.
              </p>
              </div>

					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q002">What are the costs and benefits of being a member?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a002">
					  <p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bPq0CjFP9FeSlmwQYgcJNxqA5N7i0tYj">Members fees</a> .
					         As a member you do not only get access to the property owned by the section you joined, but to all properties owned by the entire MCSA entity. You don’t strictly have to be a member for this but if you join and participate in our activities you have access to experienced members with treasure troves of knowledge to be mined.
					  </p>
            <p>
                Some outdoor shops and climbing gyms offer discounts to MCSA members. You have to be able to show your MCSA membership card.
            </p>
					  </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q010">How do I pay the membership fees? What is the club bank number?</h4>
              <div class="faqA" id="a010">
              <p>Please pay your annual membership fee, new members applications and guest fees via EFT into the Section’s bank account:

              <p><b>Parking/entrance fees:</b><br/>
              Much of our land is accessed through agreed servitudes or land owners allowing individuals to park and walk through their property. Many of these land owners make it worth their while by asking a small parking fee. A parking fee is often required and has to be paid to the landowner where we park.</p>
              <p><b>Transport:</b><br/>
              A contribution to transport costs is expected.
                Please find out beforehand what fees are payable and have the amount ready.
              </p>
              <p><b>Permit fees:</b><br/>

            </div>


					  <h4  class="faqQ" id="q015">When are Permit fees applicable?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a015">
                <p>
                  MCSA sections manage access to certain properties on which permit fees are applicable. These are properties not owned by the MCSA. You can apply for these permits online and are payable to the various sections. The permits fees are applicable to both members and non-members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Non-members wanting to visit MCSA properties without a MCSA member must apply for a permit.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q016">How do I pay the permit fees?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a016">
                <p>
                  Please note the different bank accounts for different payments.<br/>
                  Please pay via EFT into the correct bank account.<br/>

            </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q004">Why are the fees and rules different for each MCSA section?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a004">
					  <p>
              Most of the MCSA sections were independent clubs, but have now joined under the “umbrella” of the MCSA. Efforts are made to preserve the unique culture of each section and they are still run independently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most Sections of the MCSA own property and therefore must carry the risks and rewards. Each Section has their own overhead costs and own membership rate structures. An elected committee that tries to adhere to the unique requirements of that section’s members manages each of the MCSA Sections.
            </p>
            </div>


            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q017">How do I participate in MCSA events?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a017">
                <p>
                  Have a look out for any events that might interest you on our Facebook page or on our <a href="events.php">calendar</a>.
                  Then simply contact the event leader and inform him of your skill level, and ask any questions you might have.
                  Depending on the event and your skill level the meet leader will advise you re joining the outing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q018">How do I gain access to MCSA owned or managed properties?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a018">
                <p>
                  Access the website of the section of the MCSA that manages the property that you are interested in visiting.
                  Then contact that administration office in advance for the information you need.
                   If you are a MCSA member you might just need to let them know you will be visiting a site. The administrator will send you the map, access arrangements, etc. Huts must be booked in advance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are not a MCSA member you will have to request a permit to visit the area.
                  The admin office will give you all information and instructions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q005">May I take guests with to the MCSA club property or events? </h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a005">
					  <p> Members are allowed to take one guest per one club member. For more than one guest please apply for a permit. Guests may not accompany you on the first weekend of the month to any of the MCSA properties.
              Or alternatively you may make your trip an official MCSA meet and take a lot of non-members, however then the standard guest fee have to be paid to the club after the meet.
            </p>
					  </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q006">What happens if I do not pay my membership fees?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a006">
					         <p> You will not receive a sticker, which means you may not visit any of the MCSA property without a permit. If you do not pay your membership fees by November your membership with the club will be cancelled. If you would like to re-apply for membership you will have to go through the new member application process and pay the application fee again.
                   </p>
					  </div>


            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q007">Can I move from another MCSA section to the Magaliesberg section?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a007">
					  <p>If you live in Gauteng or close to Gauteng you may become a member of either the Magaliesberg section or the Johannesburg section. You will have to forward an email from the admin/treasurer/chair from the other section, which you are a member of to confirm that your fees are paid up and that you are a member in good standing. If you did not pay your annual fees at the other section or you cannot get a letter of good standing you have to follow the new member application process.
             </p>
					  </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q019">How do I, as a MCSA member, arrange official meets?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a019">
                <p>
                  Write a short description of your event (what you will do, when, where, cost, etc.) and send it to the MCSA committee member handling that portfolio (climbing/hiking/etc.). The portfolio manager will send it to the newsletter and advertise it on the Facebook page. Take note that we need to give our members 2-3 weeks to react to such an invitation so it needs to be submitted timeously.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q020">What are the responsibilities of a meet leader?</h4>
            <div class="faqA" id="a020">
                <p>
                  <ul>

                    <li>You are responsible for the safety of your group and the success of the outing (Be safe, know where you are going, etc.).</li>
                    <li>You need to have an attendance register/indemnity for signed.</li>

                  </ul>
                  </p>
            </div>

            <h4  class="faqQ" id="q012">Does the MCSA provide any equipment for events?</h4>
					  <div class="faqA" id="a012">
					  <p>
                The MCSA owns some rock climbing equipment. If the event is an official event (advertised in the newsletter with enough lead time), the meet leader is free to use (collect and return) the equipment for the event. The MCSA does not own any other equipment for events.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4  class="faqQ" id="q013">Are children welcome at events?</h4>
           <div class="faqA" id="a013">
           <p> Please check with the meet leader. Children are always welcome on condition that the event is suitable and safe for them.
         </p>
         <p>
            TAKE NOTE that the safety of the children remains the responsibility of the parent or guardian.
