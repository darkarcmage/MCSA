						Without limiting its general nature, the object shall be to, inter alia, include:

									<li>Organise and facilitate mountaineering</li>
									<li>Procure and protect real rights in and access to mountains and mountain areas</li>
									<li>Initiate and support actions towards protecting the natural beauty and wilderness character of mountains and to promote their effective conservation management</li>

						 The MCSA was founded in 1891 and, at over 125 years old, is therefore one of the oldest mountaineering clubs in the world. Over the years, the MCSA saved and invested the membership fees and through inheriting funds from members, managed to acquire spectacular mountain areas. These areas where developed with climbing crags and mountain huts in, amongst others, the Magaliesberg, Drakensberg and Table Mountain ranges.
						 The MCSA is the only mountain club in Africa affiliated with the world mountaineering body; the UIAA.
						 The Club is loosely governed by a central committee and consists of 14 sections spread over South Africa and Namibia with more than 4000 members.

					<h4>About the Magaliesberg</h4>
					<h6></h6>
					<p>‘The Magaliesberg are among the oldest mountains in the world, and stretches for 120km from Bronkhorstspruit Dam east of Pretoria to Rustenburg in the west and separates the highveld grasslands to the south, from the bushveld savannah in the north.’
					‘Water runoff from the mountains has created deep gullies and wonderful kloofs, some more than 100 meters deep, with perennial waterfalls of crystal clear water spilling from the heart of the mountain.’ These beautiful places are popular with climbers and hikers and was declared a World Biosphere Reserve by the International Coordinating Council of the Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB).

					During the mid-1800s, one of the more important Chiefs of the North-west Province area was named Mogale (or Mohale). "Mogale" means "sharp" or "clever" person, but is also the common word for a warrior or Tswana soldier. In his honor the mountains became known as Magaliesberg, or Mogale's mountain.
					Kgosi Mogale Mogale (the repetition of the name is correct) was ruler of the Bapo tribe whose territory included Krugersdorp, Kagiso, Munsieville, Magaliesburg, Hekpoort and Tarlton. A statue of Kgosi Mogale Mogale can be visited in the Krugersdorp Museum.
